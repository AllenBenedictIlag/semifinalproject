        <h2>Computer Languages we use to build our website</h2>
        <p>HTML is the abbreviation for HyperText Markup Language and is the language of the World Wide Web. It is the standard text formatting language used to create and display web pages. HTML documents are made up of two things: the content and the tags that make it up to display them correctly on the pages. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media. These are the computer languages we use in creating our website.</p>

        <h2>Application we used to Create a website</h2>
        <p>Visual Studio Code is a code editor in layman’s terms. Visual Studio Code is “a free-editor that helps the programmer write code, helps in debugging and corrects the code using the intelli-sense method ”. In normal terms, it facilitates users to write the code in an easy manner. Many people say that it is half of an IDE and an editor, but the decision is up to to the coders. Any program/software that we see or use works on the code that runs in the background. Traditionally coding was used to do in the traditional editors or even in the basic editors like notepad! These editors used to provide basic support to the coders.
        <br>
        <br>
        Some of them were so basic that it was very difficult in writing basic English level programs in them. As time went by, some programming languages needed a specific framework and support for further coding and development it, which was not possible using these editors. VI Editor, Sublime Text Editor, is one of the many kinds of editors that came into existence. The most prominent and which supports almost every coding language is VISUAL STUDIO CODE. Its features let the user modify the editor as per the usage, which means the user is able to download the libraries from the internet and integrate it with the code as per his requirements.</p>

        <h2>The compiler we use for our project is DevC++</h2>
        <p>Dev-C++ is a fully featured graphical IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that uses the MinGw compiler system to create Windows as well as Console based C/C++ applications. It can also be used with any other GCC-based compiler like Cygwin.
    <br>
    <br>        
        Dev-C++ is free software and is distributed under the GNU General Public License. Thus we can distribute or modify the IDE freely. It was originally developed by “Bloodshed Software”. It has been forked by Orwell after it was abandoned by Bloodshed in 2006.</p>
